# Loom — AI-assisted workflow for VS Code

<img src="media/loom.png" alt="Loom" width="80" />

> 🎬 **Workflow demo** — `media/loom-demo-workflow.gif` *(coming soon)*: `chat → idea → design → plan → do-step → done`, with the document graph building node-by-node in the sidebar.

Loom turns your project into a structured collaboration surface between you and AI. Instead of a chat window that forgets everything, you get a document-driven loop:

**chat → idea → design → plan → implement → done**

Every stage is a Markdown document. The AI reads them, writes to them, and tracks progress through them — across sessions, without losing context.

## Install

**1. Install the CLI** (required — the extension talks to it):

```bash
npm install -g @reslava/loom
```

**2. Install the extension** from the VS Code marketplace: search `reslava.loom`.

**3. Initialize Loom in your project**:

```bash
loom install
```

This creates `.loom/` (config), `loom/` (your doc workspace), and a `CLAUDE.md` that wires up the AI session contract.

## Connect an AI agent

Loom works best with an MCP-capable AI agent (Claude Code, Cursor). Add `.mcp.json` to your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "loom": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "loom",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "LOOM_ROOT": "${workspaceFolder}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The agent then has access to all Loom tools (`loom_create_idea`, `loom_do_step`, `loom_complete_step`, etc.) and resources (`loom://context/...`).

---

## The loop

1. **Chat** — open a chat doc, think out loud with the AI (*AI Reply*).
2. **Idea** — create one with *Weave Idea* and flesh it out with *Refine Idea*, or *Promote* a chat straight to an idea.
3. **Design** — click *Generate Design* to define how to build it.
4. **Plan** — click *Generate Plan* to get a concrete step-by-step implementation list.
5. **Implement** — click *Do Step* to have the AI implement the next step, record what was done, and mark it complete.

Each stage produces a Markdown document visible in the Loom panel. Nothing disappears between sessions.

## The LOOM panel

The **Loom** Activity Bar icon opens the Loom sidebar, which contains two views: **Threads** and **Context**.

### Threads view

Shows your **weaves** (project areas) → **threads** (workstreams) → docs (idea, design, plans, chats, done docs). Buttons appear inline on a node and in its right-click menu, grouped by what they do.

**AI actions** (run the agent):

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| *Generate Design (AI)* | Turn an idea into an architecture + decisions doc |
| *Generate Plan (AI)* | Break a design into numbered, reviewable implementation steps |
| *Do Step(s)* | AI implements the next pending step; marks it ✅ and writes a done note |
| *AI Reply* | Continue the conversation inside a chat doc with full thread context loaded |
| *Refine Idea / Design / Plan* | Re-run generation on a stale doc after its parent was updated |
| *Refresh Context* | Regenerate the `ctx.md` summary for a weave |

**Create & promote** (structure, no AI):

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| *Weave Idea / Design / Plan* | Create an idea, design, or plan doc on a thread |
| *Weave Chat* | Start a new chat doc on a thread |
| *Promote to Idea / Design / Plan / Reference* | Turn a chat or doc into the next doc type in one click |
| *Create Reference* / *Add References…* | Add a `loom/refs/` doc, or wire one into a doc's `requires_load` |

**Manage** (state & tree):

| Button | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| *Start Plan* / *Close Plan* | Move a plan to `implementing` / finish it |
| *Complete Step* | Mark the current step ✅ without running the AI |
| *Mark Done* / *Mark Active* | Flip a doc's status |
| *Rename* / *Archive* / *Delete* | Inline doc management from the tree |
| *Validate* | Check a weave for broken links and stale docs |

Right-click any node for the same actions as a context menu.

### Context view

Shows every document that *would* be loaded into the AI's context for the selected node — **before** you launch anything. Updates as you click around. What you see here is what the AI gets.

Each row is one doc, marked by why it's there:

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✓ | Auto-included (ctx, parent chain, or a matching `always` reference) |
| 📌 | You pinned it in |
| 🚫 | You excluded it |
| ⊘ | Excluded but pulled back in by another doc's `requires_load` |
| 🔒 | `load: always` — locked on (force-off prompts a warning) |
| ⚠ / ❌ | Stale / missing |

Click a row to **open the doc**. Use the inline actions to **include / exclude / reset**; choices persist per target in `.loom/context-prefs.json`. Per-doc and total token estimates let you keep launches lean.

## AI setup

Every AI button picks its path automatically:

**1. Claude Code CLI (default)**

If `claude` is on your PATH, buttons open a persistent **Loom AI** terminal and run `claude "<prompt>"`. Claude reads your Loom docs, calls the right MCP tools, and writes the result back. No API key needed — works with a Claude Pro subscription.

```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI (free with Claude Pro)
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**2. API key / sampling (fallback)**

If Claude Code CLI is not installed, the extension calls the AI provider directly via its configured API key. Set in VS Code settings:

```
reslava-loom.ai.apiKey  → your Anthropic / OpenAI / DeepSeek key
reslava-loom.ai.provider → anthropic | openai | deepseek
```

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `reslava-loom.user.name` | `User` | Your display name in chat headers |
| `reslava-loom.ai.provider` | `anthropic` | AI provider for API key path (anthropic/deepseek/openai) |
| `reslava-loom.ai.apiKey` | — | API key (fallback — not needed if Claude Code CLI is installed) |
| `reslava-loom.ai.model` | — | Model override (blank = provider default) |
