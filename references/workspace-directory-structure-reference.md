# Workspace Directory Structure

Visual reference for a complete workspace using the Reslava workflow system.
Shows both system configuration (`.wf/`) and user feature documents (`features/`).

## Key File Naming Conventions (Suffixes)

| Document Type | Filename Pattern | Example |
|---------------|-----------------|---------|
| Idea | `*-idea.md` | `payment-system-idea.md` |
| Design (primary) | `*-design.md` | `payment-system-design.md` |
| Design (supporting) | `*-design-{topic}.md` | `payment-system-design-webhooks.md` |
| Plan | `*-plan-*.md` | `payment-system-plan-001.md` |
| Context summary | `*-ctx.md` | `payment-system-ctx.md` |
| Session checkpoint | `*-ctx-{date}.md` | `payment-system-ctx-2026-04-12.md` |
| Chat (informal AI conversation) | `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md` | `2026-04-13-auth-debate.md` |

**Chat naming notes:**
- Active chats live in `chats/` with a timestamp prefix for easy sorting.
- After being consumed by a command (e.g., `wf refine-using-chat`), they are moved to `_archive/chats/YYYY-MM/` and injected with archival metadata.

---

## Design Roles

Each feature has exactly **one primary design** (the feature anchor) and any number of **supporting designs** (scoped sub-topics). Supporting designs are sorted by `created` date — no manual ordering required.

```yaml
# Primary design — required, one per feature
role: primary

# Supporting design — optional, many allowed
role: supporting
```

Plans may have either the primary or a supporting design as their `parent_id`. Feature identity always resolves to the primary design regardless of which design a plan hangs off.

---

## Context Files: Two Distinct Purposes

| File | Location | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|------|----------|---------|-----------|
| `*-ctx.md` | Feature root | Auto-generated summary of current design state | Overwritten on each generation |
| `*-ctx-{date}.md` | `ctx/` subfolder | Manual session checkpoint — what was decided, what's next | Never overwritten, permanent record |

The root ctx is always "latest summary." The `ctx/` subfolder is the historical archive.

---

## Chat Files: Lightweight AI Conversations

Chat files provide an informal, file-based scratchpad for AI conversations outside the structured workflow state machine.

| Directory | Purpose | Lifecycle |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `chats/` (workspace root) | Active, unused chat files | Created manually or via `wf chat new`. No frontmatter required. |
| `_archive/chats/YYYY-MM/` | Archived chats after being used | Moved automatically when consumed by a workflow command. Injected with metadata frontmatter (see `ai-integration-chat-docs-design.md`). |

---

## Important Files Explained

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.wf/default-wf.yml` | Built‑in default workflow (fallback if no custom config). Do not edit. |
| `.wf/workflow.yml` | User‑provided custom workflow (overrides default). |
| `.wf/templates/` | Scaffolding templates used by `wf new` commands. |
| `.wf/schemas/workflow-schema.json` | JSON Schema for `workflow.yml` — enables inline validation in VS Code. |
| `.wf/prompts/SESSION_START.md` | Bootstrap prompt to initialize AI context in external chat tools. |
| `.wf/cache/` | Local derived state cache (Git-ignored). Invalidated per-feature on any `.md` change. |
| `chats/` | Active, informal AI conversation files. |
| `features/<feature>/` | One directory per feature. Folder name = feature ID. |
| `features/<feature>/*-design.md` | PRIMARY design — anchor document, defines the feature root. Required. |
| `features/<feature>/*-design-{topic}.md` | SUPPORTING design — scoped sub-topic. Optional, many allowed. |
| `features/<feature>/plans/` | Optional subdirectory for plan documents (keeps feature root tidy). |
| `features/<feature>/ctx/` | Manual session checkpoints — historical archive, never auto-overwritten. |
| `features/_archive/features/` | Manually moved completed features — hidden from active tree view by default. |
| `features/_archive/chats/` | Archived chats that have been consumed by workflow commands. |
| `references/` | Global documents shared across features (not tied to any specific feature). |

---

## Feature Model Summary

```
Feature (identity = primary design id)
├── 1 idea                    (optional)
├── 1 design (role: primary)  (required — anchor)
├── n designs (role: supporting, sorted by created)
└── n plans   (parent_id → primary OR supporting design)
```

This structure supports feature isolation, clean archiving, and clear separation between system configuration and user content. The VS Code tree view groups documents by feature using `parent_id` links — the physical layout mirrors the logical model.
