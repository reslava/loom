# Surface release versions in the extension roadmap history

## Goal

Extension-only change wiring the release data already exposed by loom://roadmap (currentRelease, history[].release) into the roadmap tree: show the current release, label each shipped plan with its version, add a group-by-release history view, and default the history view to grouped-and-sorted-by-release (newest version first). No core/MCP changes.

## Steps

| Done | # | Step | Files touched | Blocked by | Satisfies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ✅ | 1 | Render the current release on the History band label (e.g. `History (N) · current v1.9.2`) from `roadmap.currentRelease`, and add a `[vX.Y.Z]` tag to each shipped-plan node's description in `createShippedPlanNode`. | packages/vscode/src/tree/treeProvider.ts | — | — |
| ✅ | 2 | Replace the boolean `groupByThread` history toggle with a history view mode (`date \| thread \| release`) in view state; add a `release` grouping branch in `createHistoryBand` that buckets shipped plans under their version, versions descending via core `compareVersions`. Default the mode to `release`. | packages/vscode/src/tree/treeProvider.ts, packages/vscode/src/view/viewState.ts, packages/vscode/src/view/viewStateManager.ts | show-current-and-per-plan-release | — |
| ✅ | 3 | Add a toolbar command to cycle/select the history view mode (date/thread/release) and register it (command + menu contribution) in package.json; wire it to the view-state setter. | packages/vscode/src/commands/grouping.ts, packages/vscode/package.json | release-grouping-and-mode | — |
| ✅ | 4 | `./scripts/build-all.sh`, Reload Window, and manually verify: history defaults to grouped-by-release newest-first, current release shown, each plan tagged, toggle switches date/thread/release. | — | toolbar-command | — |
