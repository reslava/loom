# Doc title H1 sync, section demotion, refs tree fix

| | |
|---|---|
| **Created** | 2026-05-23 |
| **Status** | DRAFT |
| **Design** | `{design-id}.md` |
| **Target version** | {X.X.X} |

## Goal

Make frontmatter `title` the single source of truth for doc titles, with a derived `# {Title}` H1 in every body kept in sync at the save-path chokepoint (so VS Code markdown preview renders a title). All other body H1s become H2s (with cascading demotion — H2→H3, H3→H4, etc., to preserve hierarchy). Drop dead `# CHAT` scaffolding from designs and chats. Fix the refs tree section so an empty `refs/` folder still renders (enabling Create Reference). Migrate existing docs with a dry-run script that skips old design docs (preserve their inline chat history).
