# self-hosting-repo-guard-for-loom-install Chat 001

## Rafa:

### Goal

detect a self-hosting / recursive Loom repo and skip the CLAUDE-patching + template write for it

### Why

Because loom install for end users patch:
CLAUDE.md
.loom/CLAUDE.md

and this repo use just the main special dev CLAUDE.md 

### When we decide it

during the last 1.21.2 fix done in this thread / plan:
loom/cli/bundle-first-server-delivery/plans/plan-004.md

we defered this fix 

### How

how are we going to detect a self-hosting?
via git remote repo?

### TODO

Is it the idea clear and grounded?
If so write idea

## AI:

**Vision check.** This serves "drop `loom install` into any repo and it just works" (robust, idempotent install) and protects the "Loom builds itself" dogfooding case. The manual step it removes: reverting the `.loom/CLAUDE.md` churn every time the extension silently re-installs on activation of this repo.

### First, what actually breaks today — grounding in `installWorkspace.ts`

I walked the install steps against *this* repo, and the blast radius is narrower than "patches CLAUDE.md + .loom/CLAUDE.md":

- **Step 2 — `writeIfChanged(.loom/CLAUDE.md, LOOM_CLAUDE_MD)` — this is the real damage.** The extension runs `loom_install` silently on every activation. Here `.loom/CLAUDE.md` is a source-controlled file that the sync test keeps equal to the `LOOM_CLAUDE_MD` template. While you're *editing* the template and building, the built template and the committed `.loom/CLAUDE.md` diverge → every activation rewrites the working-tree file → churn.
- **Step 3 — root `CLAUDE.md` patch — already safe here.** Both imports (`@.loom/CLAUDE.md`, `@CLAUDE-LOCAL.md`) are present, so `missing.length === 0` and nothing is patched. It only bites if those lines were removed.
- **Step 3b — `CLAUDE-LOCAL.md` — safe**, already exists (created-once, never overwritten).
- **Step 4 — `.mcp.json` — safe unless `--force`.** Our dev config is `command:"node"` local-path; `healMcpPin` only touches npx-shaped configs, and the write only fires on absent/`--force`.
- **ctx.md / settings.json — safe unless `--force`** (exist already).

So the guard's real job is narrow: **skip step 2, and defensively step 3.** But `--force` widens the radius (it *would* clobber the dev `.mcp.json` and `ctx.md`), so the guard should also make `--force` respect it.

### Detection — three options

**A. Git-remote sniff** (your suggestion): match `origin` against `reslava/loom`.
- ✗ Fragile. Forks (`contributor/loom`), no remote (fresh CI clone), SSH vs HTTPS URL forms, renamed remotes. Shells out to git. And it conflates *"is reslava/loom"* with *"is the Loom source"* — a fork **is** the source and still shouldn't be clobbered, yet has a different remote. It's guessing identity.

**B. Explicit flag in `.loom/settings.json`** — `"selfHosting": true`, committed. ← I recommend this
- ✓ Declarative and unambiguous. Travels with the repo (survives clone/fork/CI/no-remote). Read in one place inside `installWorkspace`, so it fires uniformly for **every** entry point — CLI `loom install`, the `loom_install` MCP tool, and the extension's silent activation-time install (the one that actually hurts). No git, no structural coupling.
- one-time chicken-and-egg: set it once, commit it. Trivial.

**C. Structural self-detection** — installer notices it's running inside its own source tree (root `package.json` name `@reslava/loom`, or `packages/app/src/installWorkspace.ts` present).
- ✓ Zero-config, tautologically correct (it literally *is* the source), covers forks automatically.
- ✗ Bakes repo-layout/name knowledge into the installer; heuristic.

I lean **B**. Self-hosting is a deliberate property of this one repo, not something to infer — "declare intent, don't sniff identity." C is tempting for zero-config, but coupling the installer to its own repo structure is the kind of cleverness that breaks quietly when the layout moves.

### Open questions before I'd write the idea

1. **Detection:** go with B (explicit committed flag), or do you want C's zero-config auto-detect (possibly using C to *set* the flag)?
2. **Scope of skip:** just the two CLAUDE surfaces (steps 2–3), or make install a near-total no-op on a self-hosting repo — report `self-hosting repo — skipped` and touch nothing?
3. **Should the guard also override `--force`?** I think yes: `--force` is exactly the run that would clobber the dev `.mcp.json` and `ctx.md`.

Answer these three and the idea is clear and grounded enough to write.

## Rafa:

1. B
2. no-op on a self-hosting repo 
3. yes

We also have pending deleting the already gitignored files:
- CLAUDE-LOCAL.md
- .loom/CLAUDE.md

from this repo, specially .loom/CLAUDE.md is very dangerous here

## AI:

Locked in: **B** (flag) · **near-total no-op** on self-hosting · **overrides `--force`**. So the shape is:

`installWorkspace` reads `.loom/settings.json` up front; if `selfHosting === true` it returns early — every result field `false`, plus a `skipped: "self-hosting"` marker — **before** touching any file, and this early-return sits *above* the `input.force` branch so `--force` can't punch through. The CLI prints `self-hosting repo — skipped`; the extension's silent activation-time install short-circuits automatically (same code path). Flag home confirmed: `.loom/settings.json` is **tracked & not gitignored**, so `"selfHosting": true` travels with the repo.

### On deleting the two files — verified, and it's more than a delete

I checked all of it:

- Both `.loom/CLAUDE.md` and `CLAUDE-LOCAL.md` are **gitignored + untracked** (`.gitignore:34-35`) → deleting them dirties *nothing* in git.
- The **sync test reads only root `CLAUDE.md` + `installWorkspace.ts`** — never `.loom/CLAUDE.md`. So deletion is safe for `test-all`. ✅
- **The real danger you're pointing at:** root `CLAUDE.md` (tracked) opens with `@.loom/CLAUDE.md` / `@CLAUDE-LOCAL.md`. That import silently injects the **generic** template contract *on top of* this repo's recursive dev contract — the wrong contract, pulled in invisibly, and untracked so git never warned us. Deleting the files without removing those two import lines just leaves dangling `@import`s.

So the cleanup is a **pair**: delete the files **and** remove the two `@import` lines from the tracked root `CLAUDE.md`. Those lines are neither a `<!-- rule:id -->` marker nor an invariant token, so removing them won't trip the sync test.

### Sequencing is the sharp edge

The **currently-installed extension has no guard yet**. If we delete the files first, the next activation runs `loom_install` → recreates `.loom/CLAUDE.md` **and** re-prepends the `@` imports (step 3 sees them missing). So order is non-negotiable:

1. Land the guard (flag read + early no-op above the `--force` branch) — `build-all.sh` **and reload the extension** so the *running* server has it.
2. Set `"selfHosting": true` in `.loom/settings.json` (committed).
3. Delete `.loom/CLAUDE.md` + `CLAUDE-LOCAL.md`.
4. Remove the two `@import` lines from root `CLAUDE.md`.

Steps 2–4 only become safe *after* step 1 ships, or the extension undoes them on the next window reload.

That's clear and grounded enough for me to write the idea (and then a plan). Two last calls before I do:

- **Scope:** should the idea/plan cover just the **guard** (steps 1–2), leaving the file cleanup (3–4) as a manual follow-up you do once — or should the plan own all four as its steps?
- **Where the flag is read:** `installWorkspace` currently gets `deps.registry` (ConfigRegistry) + `deps.cwd`. Read the flag through `registry` (the clean config path) vs. a direct `.loom/settings.json` read? I lean `registry` — it's the existing seam for `.loom/` config.

Say go and I'll write the idea.

## Rafa:

- scope: idea / plan: steps 1-4
- where: registry

write idea
i think we could do loom_quick_ship

## AI:

Idea written → `idea.md` (`id_01KX3TA3059YGZ15GK1Y5J5YVC`, status draft). It captures What / Why / success criteria / the 4 ordered steps, with the sequencing danger called out (guard ships before any file cleanup, or the extension undoes it).

On `loom_quick_ship`: agreed, good fit for a change this size — skip generating a pending plan + `do_step` loop, and record the finished work as one DONE plan citing this idea. One caveat baked into the idea: quick_ship is **post-work**, so it runs *last*, after steps 1–4 are implemented and verified — it's the recording action, not the doing.

Next: on `go` I'll implement **step 1 (the guard)** in `installWorkspace.ts` — read `selfHosting` via `registry`, early no-op above the `--force` branch, CLI `self-hosting repo — skipped` message — then `build-all.sh`. (Steps 2–4 only after the guard ships and you reload the extension.) Waiting for `go`.

## Rafa:

do all steps, use loom_quick_ship to create the done plan

## AI:

All four steps done, recorded as DONE plan `plan-001` (`pl_01KX3VNXAY62W4A86DNQ863WRE`) via quick_ship.

**What shipped:**
1. **Guard** — new injectable reader `packages/app/src/utils/loomSettings.ts` reads `selfHosting` from `.loom/settings.json`; `installWorkspace` returns a total no-op (`skipped: 'self-hosting'`) from **above** the `--force` branch. All three entry points (CLI, `loom_install` MCP tool, extension activation) short-circuit — they all funnel through `installWorkspace`. Added `skipped: 'self-hosting' | null` to the result; CLI prints `self-hosting repo — skipped`.
2. **Flag set** — `"selfHosting": true` in this repo's `.loom/settings.json`.
3. **Deleted** the gitignored `.loom/CLAUDE.md` + `CLAUDE-LOCAL.md`.
4. **Stripped** the two `@import` lines from root `CLAUDE.md` — so the recursive dev contract is now the *only* session contract here.

**Verified:** guard is a no-op even with `--force` (temp workspace wrote nothing); a normal repo still installs fully; `test-all` green (23 passed). Build clean.

**One correction to flag:** earlier I said the flag would be read "via `registry`" — that was wrong. `ConfigRegistry` is the *global* `~/.loom/config.yaml` multi-loom registry, not per-project settings. The correct seam for `.loom/settings.json` is a per-project reader, so I added a small dedicated `loomSettings` module (mirrors the existing `chatNames.ts` settings-read pattern) rather than force it into `ConfigRegistry`.

**Action needed from you:** the *running* extension still has the pre-guard bundle. **Reload the VS Code window** to pick up the new build — otherwise a stale-code activation could recreate `.loom/CLAUDE.md` and re-prepend the imports. After reload the guard is live and activation is a clean no-op.

Not committed yet — there's a real diff pending (packages, root `CLAUDE.md`, `.loom/settings.json`, plus the new thread docs). Say the word and I'll commit; per your roadmap-scope rule I'd keep the priority-only bits out of it.

## AI:

Committing to `main` as a single feature commit: the guard (`installWorkspace.ts`, new `loomSettings.ts`, CLI reporting), the `selfHosting` flag in `.loom/settings.json`, the root `CLAUDE.md` import removal, and this thread's new docs (idea, thread, chat, plan-001 + done). The two deleted files don't appear in the diff — they were gitignored, never tracked.

## AI:

Good tell in that `/context` snapshot — and it actually validates the feature. Memory files still lists both deleted files:

- `.loom/CLAUDE.md` — 6.5k tokens
- `CLAUDE-LOCAL.md` — 17 tokens
- `CLAUDE.md` (root) — 13.8k tokens

That's **session-start state**: all three were auto-loaded via the root `CLAUDE.md` `@import`s *before* I deleted the files and stripped the imports this session, so they're pinned in this conversation's context and won't drop until a fresh session.

The payoff shows up on the **next session** here: root `CLAUDE.md` no longer imports anything, and the two files are gone, so only the recursive contract (~13.8k) loads. This drops the generic `.loom/CLAUDE.md` template (~6.5k) that was being layered *on top* of it — that layering was the actual danger (wrong/duplicate contract), and the ~6.5k is a free side benefit. Reload the window (or start a fresh `claude`) and the Memory files list should show root `CLAUDE.md` only.
